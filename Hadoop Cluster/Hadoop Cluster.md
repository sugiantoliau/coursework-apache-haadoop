### Hadoop Cluster

#### Set up Cluster Nodes Dockerized Hadoop

Clone the repository to your theia environment.
'''
git clone https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/ooxwv-docker_hadoop.git
'''

Navigate to the docker-hadoop directory to build it.
'''
cd ooxwv-docker_hadoop
'''

Compose the docker application.
'''
docker-compose up -d
'''

Run the namenode as a mounted drive on bash.
'''
docker exec -it namenode /bin/bash
'''

#### Explore the hadoop environment


As you have learnt in the videos and reading thus far in the course, a Hadoop environment is configured by editing a set of configuration files:

hadoop-env.sh Serves as a master file to configure YARN, HDFS, MapReduce, and Hadoop-related project settings.

core-site.xml Defines HDFS and Hadoop core properties

hdfs-site.xml Governs the location for storing node metadata, fsimage file and log file.

mapred-site-xml Lists the parameters for MapReduce configuration.

yarn-site.xml Defines settings relevant to YARN. It contains configurations for the Node Manager, Resource Manager, Containers, and Application Master.

For the docker image, these xml files have been configured already. You can see these in the directory /opt/hadoop-3.2.1/etc/hadoop/ by running

'''
ls /opt/hadoop-3.2.1/etc/hadoop/*.xml
'''

<br>

#### Create a file in the HDFS

In the HDFS, create a directory structure named user/root/input.
'''
hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /user/root/input
'''


Copy all the hadoop configuration xml files into the input directory.
'''
hdfs dfs -put $HADOOP_HOME/etc/hadoop/*.xml /user/root/input
'''


Create a data.txt file in the current directory.
'''
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/ooxwv-docker_hadoop/master/SampleMapReduce.txt --output data.txt
'''

Copy the data.txt file into /user/root.
'''
hdfs dfs -put data.txt /user/root/
'''

Check if the file has been copied into the HDFS by viewing its content.
'''
hdfs dfs -cat /user/root/data.txt
'''
